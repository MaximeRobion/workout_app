# What I'm working on

MVP:
- Each workout has a date and a note
- In each workout, there are many exercises
- Exercises are a compilation of a movement and a serie (weights and reps)
- While doing a serie, one can see the previous performance on this movement

Todo for MVP
- [] Add a movement if it doesn't exist yet
- [] Add series to an exercise
- [] Update, Destroy for the right objects
- [] CSS
- [] Navigation
- [] Turbo it all
- [] Test everything
- [] User logging

Features for the future...
- SuperSets (Exercise with 2 movements)
- Notes on the serie / feedback if need to increase or decrease
- Movements have a picture
- Handle KG and LBS
- Home page with stats
- Timer
