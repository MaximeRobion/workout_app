# What I'm working on

MVP:
- Each workout has a date and a note
- In each workout, there are many exercises
- Exercises are a compilation of a movement and a serie (weights and reps)
- While doing a serie, one can see the previous performance on this movement

Todo for MVP
- [x] Add a movement if it doesn't exist yet
- [x] Add series to an exercise
- [x] Update, Destroy for the right objects
- [x] Navigation
- [x] Last of the same serie of the same movement
- [x] Better handling of local time with local_time gem & timezone config
- [x] Everything to simple_form
- [x] Add logs
- [x] Flash messages
- [x] CSS (could get some improvements after Turbo)
- [] Update and delete movements
- [] Turbo it all
- [] Better routes (no nesting 2 folds)
- [] Update all objects
- [] Empty states
- [] Test everything
- [] Users & Devise gem > workout & movements belong to user
